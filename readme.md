# Vanilla theme
A drupal8 theme, build as a documentation project for new frontenders coming into Drupal.

All issues & discussions will be done at drupal.org
https://www.drupal.org/project/vanilla

Im sick n tired of patches, after 3+ years of hammering on core, and PR’s is easier to work with.

yup there will not be any d.o commit counts or anything else if you choose to help out, but oooh well ;)

## Vanilla 
the name vanilla is chosen as the theme isn’t about being pretty, but to provide a starting ground so you can find anything

### css 
Im personally a fan of Vanilla CSS, but no worries grunt-gulp-sass-libsass-postcss-ruby-whatever  will document an easy way to add in you pre/post process css love.

### standard theme files:
* logo.svg default logo file added in with the branding block.
* vanilla.info.yml
* vanilla.theme
* vanilla.breakpoints.yml

## Template folder structure


## basetheme:
Drupal have 2 base themes that you should use:

### base theme: classy 
This theme pack all the default classes & markup for Drupal8, we cleaned a lot out of the original Drupal7 markup.
classys templates is located in code/themes/classy

### base theme: stable
Stable is Drupal8 base minimum templates, where we tried to remove almost anything out of it, so only the bare minimum classes.
stables templates is located in code/themes/stable
### base theme: false
If you a brave cowboy, you can ignore the base theme, it will actually still use drp
“false” still have templates ;) they are located in core/modules/[modulename]/templates/ 
warning: core markup will change over time, as we continue to cleanup & make it better.
