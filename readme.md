# Vanilla theme
A drupal8 theme, build as a documentation project for new frontenders coming into Drupal.

All issues & discussions will be done at drupal.org
https://www.drupal.org/project/vanilla

Im sick n tired of patches, after 3+ years of hammering on core, and PR’s is easier to work with.

yup there will not be any d.o commit counts or anything else if you choose to help out, but oooh well ;)

## Vanilla 
the name vanilla is chosen as the theme isn’t about being pretty, but to provide a starting ground so you can find anything

### css 
Im personally a fan of Vanilla CSS, but no worries grunt-gulp-sass-libsass-postcss-ruby-whatever  will document an easy way to add in you pre/post process css love.
