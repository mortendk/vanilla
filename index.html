<h1>Vanilla theme</h1>
<p>
  the vanilla theme is a "Learn how to do all the things in Drupal8" with a theme
  that dont have any flavour, that sound fancy, in reality its a collection of documentation
  and theming best practices, where I try to navigate away from the last Drupalism's
  that still exist.
</p>

<h3>Principles:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>CSS clases should not be named on the machine that creats it</li>
  <li>Show all possible variables in the code, if its possible split variables out so its quick to move around</li>
  <li>Provide urls to documentation, cause were stupid </li>
  <li>If templates needs to cleaned up more, put em in own directory</li>
  <li>Document the css with kss</li>
</ol>

<h3>Issues & bug reports:</h3>
<p>
All development are dont on github, cause honestly drupal's patches is harder to get into, and i hope to get more frontender involved, also i like PR's more than patch files.
</p>
<p>
But all issues & releases will be done on d.o
