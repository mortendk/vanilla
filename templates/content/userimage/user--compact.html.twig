@TODO we should add in a seperate template for this when we print the
user image on a node, else its gonna be a pita to control.
so we can control what comes out.
in vanilla we have added a theme suggestion for the view modes

the userfield can be changed at:
/admin/config/people/accounts/display
{{ attributes }}
#}

{{ content.user_picture }}
{{ content|without('user_picture') }}
